## Database Description

User input is saved in the browser cache to provide a seamless and personalized experience. However, for initial album picks, users can load predefined selections from a MongoDB database hosted in the cloud.

### Using MongoDB

To access the MongoDB data, you'll need credentials. If you're interested in exploring this feature, please contact me to get the required credentials.

### Setting Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following:

```env
DB_USER=user
DB_PASS=password
DB_CLUSTER=cluster
